# Portfolio

This is a rough representation of my portfolio that is for the assigned Challenge 2.

It is very lacking in terms of content since I have not worked on anything substantial that is worth putting on my portfolio.

I have used a lot of the code for the example but tried to change as much of my own stuff as possible.
